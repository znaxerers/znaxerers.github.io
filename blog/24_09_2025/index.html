        <h2>24/09/25 - What I've been up to</h2>
          Heyyo! to whoever is reading this -
          <br><br> So looking at the commit logs, the last time I updated the site was about 4 months ago so this is basically a 4 month update.
          <br><br> Haven't really been up to much up until 2 weeks ago, just getting used to working at my webdev job - not really what I thought I'd be doing with my life
          but it's nice to get paid and becoming a better programmer/code designer thanks to working with alot of other smarter programmers than me.
          <br><br> I think my plan last time was to make a DS homebrew for my unfinished game idea? Yeah, I ended up putting that on hold because... well honestly, I was mostly doing that because
          all the junior-level gamedev jobs wanted some kind of C++ experience and at first I was going to do OpenGL since it was trending<i>(-ish)</i> but I ended up getting blocked alot and moved on to 
          DS homebrewing which was pretty interesting but I also ended up getting blocked alot too - and honestly, I don't really think my heart was in it to do any of those things - 
          I was just desperate to figure out how to make a living by doing what I thought was <i>real</i> gamedev to other people.
          <br><br> But after working at my job for 4 months and thinking about where my life is going from here, I've come to realize that:
          <ul>
            <li>Jobs suck.</li>
            <li>I don't think dream jobs are real. </li>
            <li>Jobs suck but you need money or else everything sucks. </li>
            <li>Nobody knows where value comes from.</li> 
          </ul>
          So... <i><small><s>(I kinda lost my train of thought writing this list ngl...)</s></small></i>
          <br><br> I'm not gonna be the person I want to be by doing what other people think is valuable - which is honestly kinda what I've been doing my whole life up until now...
          <br><br> So I've <i>kind of</i> resolved myself by just trusting what's valuable to me and to let go of everything else that doesn't build to that.
        <br> <br> This has gotten pretty long-winded so to summarize what I actually been doing because of my "resolve":
        <ul>
            <li>Working on SkeleSkribe again. (Designing & GameMaker) </li>
            <li>Learning how to make chiptunes. (PXTone & Stealing Music Source Files) </li>
            <li>Looking at other GameMaker games source code for code design. </li> 
          </ul>
          Knowing me, 4 months from now I don't know if all these things I wrote down will still be true but right now, I feel like it is and I gotta trust that. 
          <br><br>Anyway, more small life updates on my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/znaxerers.bsky.social">bsky.app</a>, bye now!!!
